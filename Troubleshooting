Problem - 1 : When you are running BiomarT, you could possibly find an error like: 
" 
Error in `collect()`:
! Failed to collect lazy table.
Caused by error in `db_collect()`:
! Arguments in `...` must be used.
Problematic argument:
 ..1 = Inf
 Did you misspell an argument name?
Run `rlang::last_trace()` to see where the error occurred.
" 

... This is an error caused by incompatibility between dbplyr and BiocFileCache. Nothing much to do with biomaRt!

I tried all the way to resolve it, but eventually didn't work !

Then how do i solved it ?!

Well , in the meantime, bioconductor have updated "BiocFileCache" and released a new Bioconductor version. 

I had to re-install everything from R, R Studio to Bioconductor!
It resolved!!!
